Lao-Tzu's quote -- "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step" -- is more correctly translated as "The journey of a thousand miles begins beneath one's feet". So here I stand. I have often thought that a reflection on the various technical challenges and solutions I run into would be valuable not only for me but for others on similar paths, so this stretch of 1,000 miles starts here and now.
