{"name":"Committed","tagline":"...the story of things I've put in version control","body":"### Welcome to Committed.\r\nI've been working with Linux and other open-source / Free software since 1997. I've built a career around navigating and advising about these software projects, and yet I have always been somewhat...shy...about making these experiences public. Thus, my various employers have benefited from the experience, but I have not been giving back nearly as much to the community as I have gained from it.\r\n\r\nThat needs to change.\r\n\r\nAs an engineering-minded individual, solving problems is basically my *thing*, man, so what better way to solve this problem than by setting up a space to share my experiences?\r\n\r\nAnd here we are. My first steps on this journey center around [GStreamer][gstreamer] and [Python][python]. [Head over][gst-examples] and take a look at the work in progress.\r\n\r\n[gstreamer]: http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org\r\n[python]: http://python.org\r\n[gst-examples]: http://dwink.github.io/gst-examples\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
