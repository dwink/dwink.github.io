<p>I've been working with Linux and other open-source / Free software since 1997. I've built a career around navigating and advising about these software projects, and yet I have always been somewhat...shy...about making these experiences public. Thus, my various employers have benefited from the experience, but I have not been giving back nearly as much to the community as I have gained from it.</p>

<p>That needs to change.</p>

<p>As an engineering-minded individual, solving problems is basically my <em>thing</em>, man, so what better way to solve this problem than by setting up a space to share my experiences?</p>

<p>And here we are. My first steps on this journey center around <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org">GStreamer</a> and <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>. <a href="http://dwink.github.io/gst-examples">Head over</a> and take a look at the work in progress.</p>
